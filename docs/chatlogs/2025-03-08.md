# Flambient.io Development Log - March 8, 2025

## Summary
Today's development focused on simplifying and improving the EXIF data extraction process. The changes resulted in a more reliable and maintainable implementation that accurately identifies flash and ambient exposure settings.

## Key Achievements

### 1. ExifExtractionService Refinement
- Simplified the EXIF extraction logic while maintaining functionality
- Implemented clear error handling with structured responses
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Successfully processes both flash and ambient exposure metadata

### 2. Database Integration
- Clean database schema implementation
- Successful batch processing of multiple images
- Accurate metadata storage with proper relationships

### 3. Upload System Verification
- Confirmed successful handling of multiple image uploads
- Proper batch ID generation and management
- Accurate EXIF data extraction and storage
- Real-time progress updates to users

## Technical Details for Future Development

### EXIF Data Patterns
```
Flash Patterns:
- Ambient: "Off, Did not fire" (values: 0, 16, 24)
- Flash: "On, Return detected" (values: 5, 13, 29)

Exposure Settings:
- Ambient: ISO 400, 1/4-1/6 sec, f/8
- Flash: ISO 200, 1/80-1/160 sec, f/8
```

### Database Structure
```
Relationships:
- One batch has many images
- One image has one metadata record
- Metadata directly linked to image via UUID
```

### Response Format
```php
[
    'success' => bool,
    'error' => string|null,
    'metadata' => [
        'flash' => string,
        'exposure_mode' => string,
        'white_balance' => string,
        'iso' => int,
        'exposure_time' => string,
        'aperture' => string
    ]
]
```

## Development Guidelines
1. Keep EXIF extraction focused on essential fields
2. Maintain clear error messages in logs
3. Use UUIDs for all primary keys
4. Follow established naming conventions
5. Keep services page-specific where possible
